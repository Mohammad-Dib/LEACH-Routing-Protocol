The implementation of LEACH, a hierarchical routing protocol, in Python. K-means clustering algorithm is used to cluster the nodes based on their location.

The operation of the protocol:
1. Number of cluster heads rotations will be specified
2. A cluster head will be chosen for each cluster
3. A random sensor node will be randomly chosen as a source to send a message to the base station
4. The process will be repeated multiple times

The following parameters are monitored throughout the operation of the network:
- The number of dead nodes
- The number of transmitted messages
- The number of received messages by the base station
- The total energy of the network
